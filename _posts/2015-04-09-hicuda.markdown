Basic Concept
---
hiCUDA suggests a new approach for general purpose GPU programming. Traditionally, programmers were expected to identify *parallelizable* code within their program, manually write GPU kernel code and manage data transfer between the host and GPUs. Obviously, this is an extremely tedious and error-prone task. With hiCUDA, programmers still need to identify parallelizable code blocks but they no longer need to hand-operate everything else. This is achieved by the `#pragma` directive available in the C/C++ preprocessor. There are two main aspects to focus on: computation and data.

For those who would like to try out hiCUDA project page can be found [here](http://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~tsa/hicuda/).

Computation Model
---

hiCUDA provides a few directives to control how things are computed. The `kernel` directive denotes a region in which can be converted to a CUDA kernel.

    #pragma hicuda kernel ...
    #pragma hicuda kernel_end

The `loop_partition` directive provides fine-grained control on how loops can be distributed over threads or thread blocks.

    #pragma hicuda loop_partition

Finally, the `singular` directive allows programmers to identify kernel code to be executed only once in a thread block.

    #pragma hicuda singular
    #pragma hicuda singular_end


Data Model
---

hiCUDA provides three main directives: `global`, `constant` and `shared`. Besides those three directives, there is an auxiliary directive to specify dimensions of arrays.

    #pragma hicuda shape ptr-var-sym {[dim-size]}+

Each of those three main directives supports one or more of the following operations:

* `alloc`
* `copyin`
* `copyout`
* `free`
* `remove`

Most of operations are self-explanatory except it is not entirely clear why `global` is paired with `free` while others are paired with `remove`.

Weaknesses
---

Although hiCUDA has done an excellent job in providing an abstraction layer for GPU programming, there are still some room for improvement.

* C/C++ only; a different approach is required for other languages with no preprocessor.
* Code inside a kernel region must be *primitive*; this prevents programmers to fully utilize rich libraries and frameworks available on the host.
* Texture memory cannot be accessed.
