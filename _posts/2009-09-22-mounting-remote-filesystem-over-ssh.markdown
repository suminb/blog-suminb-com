I've been using this shell script for a long time and it works pretty well unless I have really slow network connection. When I upgraded to Snow Leopard from Leopard, the installer got rid of all files under `/Volumes` directory where this script was located. I probably should've put the file under `/usr/bin`. So I'm posting this as a backup just in case I lose the file again, but please feel free to use it if you have `sshfs` installed on your system.

URI=user@dev.sumin.us

OPTIONS="reconnect,follow_symlinks"

if [ ! -d $MOUNTPOINT ]; then
	mkdir $MOUNTPOINT
fi

sshfs -o $OPTIONS $URI: $MOUNTPOINT
