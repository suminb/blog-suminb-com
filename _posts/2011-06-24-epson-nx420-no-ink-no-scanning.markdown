I know I complain a lot for everything, but I really think this is worth complaining.

This morning, I was going to scan a bank statement before submitting to the international student office at the university. My all-in-one printer/scanner was sleeping in the closet so it was a pretty good excuse to unpack it and to bring it to life. I turned it on and found that nothing works due to an empty black ink cartridge. What the ef!?

I literally tried every single button on the stupid printer but no luck. I cannot scan a damn thing because there is no black ink. It's like you can't inquiry your balance in an ATM because it is out of twenty-dollar bills.

[Someone has pointed out](http://forums.cnet.com/7723-7590_102-306489.html) the reason behind is this to keep the inkjets from clogging when left too long with no new ink (wet ink). Sort of understandable, but I disagree. A warning message should be enough. There is no reason to assume every user of the printer is stupid. Ignorant users will screw up something no matter what.
